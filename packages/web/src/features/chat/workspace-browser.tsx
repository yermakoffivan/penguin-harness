 * Workspace file browser (the "Browse All" tab of the Files panel): directory navigation

 * modified time), preview (Markdown/HTML default to a rendered view + a source toggle, text/
 * images shown inline, other types prompt a download), upload (multi-select in the current

 * auto-creating missing parent directories within the sandbox, an API-level capability).
 *
 * Single-column list <-> preview drill-down (no side-by-side layout): the panel's width is
 * controlled by the outer Files panel and may be much narrower than the viewport, so `lg:`-style
 * viewport breakpoints would misjudge things here (a wide viewport doesn't mean this component
 * got a wide allotment of space) — so the list and preview are shown mutually exclusively,
 * routed by whether the existing `preview` is null, without introducing extra state.
