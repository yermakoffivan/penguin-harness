/**
 * Active Session runtime.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - get-or-resume-or-heal: use it directly on an active-table hit; with a Trace,
 *     recover via `agent.resumeSession`; a stale Session that was created but never run
 *     and survived a process restart (no Trace) **self-heals** — recreated via
 *     createSession using the index row's workspace/modelId, yielding a new session_id
 *     and updating the index's primary key; the Task response body always returns the
 *     current actual id;
 *   - Vault effectiveness: a vault update bumps the Agent's config generation
 *     (invalidateAgentRuntimes); runtimes built earlier are discarded on their next
 *     idle access and re-resumed, so the next Task always runs with current values;
 *   - Per-Session mutual exclusion: only one Task/compaction may be in progress at a
 *     time;
 *   - run/compact drive: consumes the output stream in the background, publishing each
 *     message to the SSE channel and handing it to usage-recorder for persistence;
 *     on completion (including errors) resets to idle and pushes a `task_state` server
 *     event;
 *   - Approval registration and interrupt convergence: each approval decision re-reads
 *     approval_mode from the DB (takes effect immediately); an interrupt first
 *     converges pending approvals to deny, then aborts.
 *
 * The underlying implementation of get-or-resume-or-heal is injected via
 * `SessionLoader`: production uses the core SDK (createCoreSessionLoader), tests inject
 * a fake Session (issuing no real LLM requests).
