# Penguin Harness SDK

`@prismshadow/penguin-core` is the TypeScript SDK this agent itself runs on. Use it to build your own AI apps:

- An **Agent** loads its state (prompts, tools, skills) from `<root>/<project_id>/agents/<agent_id>/`. Creating an Agent whose directory is empty initializes it with defaults.
- A **Session** is one conversation of an Agent inside a **Workspace** directory.
- `session.run()` executes one task and streams every step (thinking, text, tool calls) as OmniMessages.

To have an agent perform a task, use the `run_subagent` tool — the SDK is for building applications, not for invoking agents.

## Before you start

If the user's message only invokes this skill (e.g. "use penguin-sdk skill") without a concrete app to build, ask the user what they want to build. But when the request names a concrete goal — even a single sentence like "build a RAG app that answers questions about these docs" — do **not** ask follow-up questions: build it end to end with the defaults in this skill (self-contained workspace project, project default model, BM25 retrieval, web UI styled per the web-design skill) and list the assumptions you made in your final reply.

## Project location

Create the app in the current workspace directory by default (the `CWD` value from your Environment section), as a self-contained project — do not place it under `<app_data_dir>` (PenguinHarness's app data root) or depend on any path outside the project folder. When creating the app's agent, the data root defaults **under the working directory (CWD)** too: point `createAgent({ root })` at a directory inside the project, resolved from the source file so it stays relative:

```ts
const agent = await createAgent({ root: path.join(import.meta.dirname, "penguin_data") });
```

With every reference relative to the project, the user can move or copy the folder anywhere and it still runs.

## Keys and the data root — check before you build

**The app's Penguin data root must live inside the CWD workspace — never `~/.penguin`.** Point `createAgent({ root })` and every `penguin config ... --root <dir>` at a directory under the current working directory (e.g. `./penguin_data`); the global `~/.penguin` belongs to the person running Penguin and must never hold — or lend — the app's config or keys.

**Credential first, code second** — a finished app that cannot answer is a failed delivery discovered too late. Before writing any code:

```bash
env | grep -oE "(DEEPSEEK|OPENAI|ANTHROPIC|GEMINI)_API_KEY" || echo none
```

**Only two sources count as a usable credential**: a vault-injected environment variable (the check above; vault keys also appear in your Vault Keys section), or a key already configured in the app's own data root (`penguin config model list --root <data_dir>`). Keys in the global `~/.penguin` or any other `.penguin` directory do **not** count — a bare `penguin config model list` (no `--root`) reads the global store, because the CLI defaults to the global root unless `--root` is given, so a key showing up there proves nothing for the app and must never be used or copied.

If neither counted source yields a key, **stop immediately and ask the user to configure one — do not start building, and do not burn turns re-checking in a loop**: have them open this agent's settings via the **gear icon** on its card (left side, Agents page) and add a model API key (e.g. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) in the **key vault** tab — vault values reach your shell environment on the next task. One clear check, then hand back to the user. Build only after a credential is confirmed, or after clearly agreeing with the user to build now and verify later. Model ids to offer the user come from the penguin CLI catalog (`penguin config model add --help`) and the agenthub-models skill's id table.

## Setup

```bash
npm install @prismshadow/penguin-core tsx
```

If the package is not on your npm registry (it is developed in the PenguinHarness monorepo and may not be published), develop inside a checkout of the PenguinHarness repo instead: add your app as a workspace package under `packages/`, depend on `"@prismshadow/penguin-core": "workspace:*"`, then `pnpm install && pnpm build` at the repo root. Tell the user which route you took.

Configure a model for the app's data root, in this order — stop at the first that works:

1. `penguin config model add --root <data_dir> --provider <group> --model-id <id> --api-key <key> [--base-url <url>] [--client-type openai] --set-default` — prefer `--client-type openai --base-url <endpoint>` (works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; exact ids in the agenthub-models skill). `--provider` is required: a model is always the `(provider, model_id)` pair and the group is never inferred from the id (`custom` for an endpoint outside the built-in groups).
2. Environment variables cover the **credential only** (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …) — model selection still comes from the project config, whose preset default is `deepseek-v4-flash`. Env-only setup therefore works out of the box only with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; for another vendor either run the CLI command above or pass a configured `{ provider, modelId }` pair to `createSession`.

Keep model API keys **project-local**: configure them with the penguin CLI into the app's own data root under the working directory, so the project stays self-contained and movable. When building an AI app, **always pass `--root <data_dir>` pointing at the app's data directory inside the current working directory** (the same path you give `createAgent({ root })`, e.g. `./penguin_data`) — never run `penguin config ...` without `--root`, or it writes to the global `~/.penguin/data` instead of the project. Never read, copy or fall back to model keys stored in the user's global `~/.penguin` directory — that config belongs to the person running Penguin, not to the app you are building.

Model config lives in one hidden file under the data root's project directory: `.project_config.toml`. It is CLI-only — never read, print or edit it.

If the user agreed to build before a credential exists, do not fake the verification: finish the build, report it as **unverified**, and point them at the key vault flow above — once a key is added, vault values reach your environment on the next task and you can run the self-test to completion.

## Streaming loop

The raw `run()` stream mixes model, event and session-meta payloads — always narrow with the exported guards (`isModelMessage`, `isCompleteModelMessage`, `isEventMessage`) before touching `payload.type`; accessing `msg.payload.type` directly does not typecheck.

```ts
import path from "node:path";
import readline from "node:readline/promises";
import { createAgent, isModelMessage, userText } from "@prismshadow/penguin-core";

const agent = await createAgent({ root: path.join(import.meta.dirname, "penguin_data") });
const session = await agent.createSession({ workspaceDir: process.cwd() });

const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout });
for (;;) {
  const line = await rl.question("> ");
  if (!line.trim()) break;
  // One run per user turn; the same Session keeps the conversation context.
  for await (const msg of session.run([userText(line)], {
    approve: async () => "allow", // demo only — a real app should ask its user ("deny" blocks the call)
  })) {
    if (isModelMessage(msg)) {
      const p = msg.payload;
      if (p.type === "partial_text" && p.event_type === "delta") process.stdout.write(p.text);
      // CoT stream from reasoning models — show progress, but keep it out of the answer channel.
      if (p.type === "partial_thinking" && p.event_type === "delta") process.stderr.write(p.thinking);
    }
  }
  process.stdout.write("\n");
}
rl.close();
session.dispose();
```

- `createSession({ workspaceDir, provider, modelId })` — `workspaceDir` must already exist (omit for a temporary workspace); the model reference is the `(provider, modelId)` pair, so pass both to pick a configured model or neither for the project default — passing one alone throws.
- The `approve` callback gates every tool call; **omitting it denies everything**.
- `opts.thinkingLevel` (`"none" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh"`) overrides the agent's default (`model.thinking_level` in `system_config.yaml`) for this turn only — raise it for hard questions, drop it for latency-sensitive calls like titling or classification.
- Session lifetime is the app's memory model: reuse one Session for a stateful chat (context accumulates, as above), create one per request for stateless QA (the RAG recipe below); either way call `session.dispose()` when done to release background processes.
- An Agent's behavior is edited in its `agent_state/` files (system_config.yaml, AGENTS.md, skills/), not in code.

## Thinking and image messages

Modern models think before answering and accept images; the stream and the input protocol carry both — use them instead of flattening everything to text.

**Thinking (CoT) out.** Reasoning models stream `partial_thinking` (field `thinking`) before any `partial_text`, and a complete `thinking` message follows. Show the stream — a silent 20-second wait reads as a hang — but keep it in its own channel: a collapsible muted block per the web-design skill, auto-collapsed once answer text starts. Never concatenate thinking into the answer, store it as the answer, or cite from it; ignore its `fidelity` field (core's replay bookkeeping). Non-reasoning models simply never emit it — don't reserve UI space.

**Images in.** Build image input with `imageUrlMessage` (a web URL or a base64 data URL) beside `userText` in the same `run` input:

```ts
import { imageUrlMessage, userText } from "@prismshadow/penguin-core";
session.run([userText(question), ...images.map(imageUrlMessage)], { ... });
```

Browser flow: `<input type="file" accept="image/*">` plus paste/drag-drop → `FileReader.readAsDataURL` → POST `{ question, images: [dataUrl] }` → the server maps each entry to `imageUrlMessage`. Reject non-image MIME types and cap size (a data URL rides the context window; a few MB is plenty). Whether the session model actually sees pixels is the model config's `vision` flag (`penguin config model list` prints `vision=Y/-`; set via `--vision/--no-vision` on `model add`, default supported): with `vision=false` the core folds the image into an `[attached image: <path>]` line and the built-in image tools read it through the project's configured `vision_model` (`penguin config model vision --provider <group> --model-id <id> --root <data_dir>`) — the app still works, through a description instead of direct sight.

**Other payloads worth handling** (always narrow with the guards first): `partial_tool_call` / `partial_tool_call_output` — surface as an activity line ("running `search`…") in apps that grant tools; `request_end` (event) — a non-`completed` `status` is the error signal (`auth` → ask for a key; `message` carries the failure detail; `retry_in_ms` announces a planned in-run retry, renderable as a countdown); `token_usage` (event) — session-cumulative and last-request counts, if the app shows cost; `compaction_begin` / `compaction_end` (events) — long-lived chats only, show a brief "context being compacted" notice. Everything else is safe to ignore.

## RAG knowledge app

The default recipe when the user wants an app that answers questions over a document set ("docs QA", "knowledge base", "chat with our docs", "become an expert on X"). The core contributes the agent loop only — retrieval is app code. Default to **lexical BM25**: no extra dependencies, no embedding credential, works offline. (Semantic upgrade: embed chunks via `@prismshadow/agenthub` — see the agenthub-models skill — and rank by cosine; only when an embedding-capable key is configured.)

```
my-app/
  package.json       # "type": "module"; scripts: ingest / start
  persona.md         # the embedded agent's role — write it per the agent-creation skill
  ingest.ts          # corpus/ → data/index.json; initializes penguin_data/, installs persona
  rag.ts             # BM25 retrieval over the chunk index
  server.ts          # POST /api/ask streams SSE; serves public/
  public/index.html  # chat UI — build it per the web-design skill
  corpus/            # collected source documents
  data/index.json    # generated chunk index
  penguin_data/      # agent data root (generated; model config lives here)
```

**Collect** — clone or fetch the sources into `corpus/`, keeping only text formats:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 <repo_url> corpus/<name>   # or curl pages into corpus/
find corpus -type f ! -regex '.*\.\(md\|mdx\|txt\|html?\)$' -delete && rm -rf corpus/*/.git
```

**Ingest** (`ingest.ts`) — split on markdown headings, cap chunk size, write one JSON index; also initialize `penguin_data/`, install the persona and strip the skills the embedded agent doesn't need:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import { createAgent } from "@prismshadow/penguin-core";

const ROOT = import.meta.dirname;
const walk = (d: string): string[] =>
  fs.readdirSync(d, { withFileTypes: true }).flatMap((e) =>
    e.isDirectory() ? walk(path.join(d, e.name)) : [path.join(d, e.name)]);

const STATE = path.join(
  ROOT, "penguin_data", "default_project", "agents", "default_agent", "agent_state");
await createAgent({ root: path.join(ROOT, "penguin_data") });
fs.copyFileSync(path.join(ROOT, "persona.md"), path.join(STATE, "AGENTS.md"));
// A fresh default_agent is initialized with the whole built-in Skill library, and every installed
// Skill's metadata is injected into the system prompt of every /api/ask. This app only answers
// from retrieved context, so remove them: unrelated skill descriptions cost tokens on each
// question and pull the answer off-topic when one happens to match the wording of a question.
fs.rmSync(path.join(STATE, "skills"), { recursive: true, force: true });

const chunks: { id: number; source: string; heading: string; text: string }[] = [];
for (const f of walk(path.join(ROOT, "corpus")).filter((f) => /\.(md|mdx|txt|html?)$/i.test(f))) {
  const raw = fs.readFileSync(f, "utf8");
  const text = /\.html?$/i.test(f) ? raw.replace(/<[^>]+>/g, " ") : raw;
  const source = path.relative(ROOT, f);
  let heading = path.basename(f);
  for (const block of text.split(/^(?=#{1,3} )/m)) {
    heading = block.match(/^#{1,3} (.+)/)?.[1] ?? heading;
    for (let i = 0; i < block.length; i += 1500) {
      const piece = block.slice(i, i + 1500).trim();
      if (piece.length > 40) chunks.push({ id: chunks.length, source, heading, text: piece });
    }
  }
}
fs.mkdirSync(path.join(ROOT, "data"), { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(ROOT, "data", "index.json"), JSON.stringify(chunks));
console.log(`indexed ${chunks.length} chunks`);
```

**Retrieve** (`rag.ts`) — standard BM25 (k1 = 1.2, b = 0.75); the tokenizer treats each CJK character as a token so Chinese queries work. The corpus-wide statistics (per-chunk term frequencies, document frequencies, average length) never change once the corpus is indexed, so build them **once** in `loadIndex` — a per-query rescan would make every question O(corpus):

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

export interface Chunk { id: number; source: string; heading: string; text: string }
export interface Index {
  chunks: Chunk[];
  tf: Map<string, number>[]; // per-chunk term → count
  len: number[];             // per-chunk token length
  df: Map<string, number>;   // term → number of chunks containing it
  avg: number;               // mean chunk length (BM25 length normalization)
}

const tokenize = (s: string): string[] => s.toLowerCase().match(/[a-z0-9]+|[一-鿿]/g) ?? [];

export function loadIndex(): Index {
  const chunks: Chunk[] = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(path.join(import.meta.dirname, "data", "index.json"), "utf8"));
  const tf: Map<string, number>[] = [];
  const len: number[] = [];
  const df = new Map<string, number>();
  for (const c of chunks) {
    const toks = tokenize(`${c.heading} ${c.text}`);
    const m = new Map<string, number>();
    for (const t of toks) m.set(t, (m.get(t) ?? 0) + 1);
    for (const t of m.keys()) df.set(t, (df.get(t) ?? 0) + 1);
    tf.push(m);
    len.push(toks.length);
  }
  const avg = len.reduce((n, l) => n + l, 0) / Math.max(len.length, 1);
  return { chunks, tf, len, df, avg };
}

export function search(index: Index, query: string, k = 6): Chunk[] {
  const { chunks, tf, len, df, avg } = index;
  const q = [...new Set(tokenize(query))];
  const score = (i: number): number => {
    let s = 0;
    for (const t of q) {
      const f = tf[i]!.get(t) ?? 0;
      if (f === 0) continue;
      const n = df.get(t) ?? 0;
      s += Math.log(1 + (chunks.length - n + 0.5) / (n + 0.5)) *
        (f * 2.2) / (f + 1.2 * (0.25 + (0.75 * len[i]!) / avg));
    }
    return s;
  };
  return chunks.map((_, i) => [score(i), i] as const)
    .filter(([s]) => s > 0).sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]).slice(0, k)
    .map(([, i]) => chunks[i]!);
}
```

**Answer & serve** (`server.ts`) — one Session per request (stateless QA), retrieved chunks numbered into the prompt, deltas streamed over SSE, sources sent as the final event. A pure QA session needs no tool calls — deny every approval; a denied or tool-less turn terminates normally. Do **not** clear the toolset with `tools: { builtin: [] }`: an empty tools array is sent to the provider verbatim and some OpenAI-compatible endpoints reject it with a 400, which surfaces as a silent empty answer. Guard the request boundary — a malformed body must return 400, never reject the async handler (an unhandled rejection takes the whole server down) — and abort the run if the client disconnects mid-answer so you stop generating (and paying) for a page nobody is reading.

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import http from "node:http";
import path from "node:path";
import { createAgent, isModelMessage, userText } from "@prismshadow/penguin-core";
import { loadIndex, search } from "./rag.ts";

const ROOT = import.meta.dirname;
const PUB = path.join(ROOT, "public");
const agent = await createAgent({ root: path.join(ROOT, "penguin_data") });
const index = loadIndex();
const MIME: Record<string, string> = { ".html": "text/html", ".css": "text/css", ".js": "text/javascript" };

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  res.on("error", () => {}); // a client that vanishes mid-write must not throw an uncaught EPIPE
  if (req.method === "POST" && req.url === "/api/ask") {
    let question: string;
    try {
      let body = "";
      for await (const part of req) body += part; // a mid-body connection reset rejects here — caught below, never fatal
      const parsed = JSON.parse(body) as { question?: unknown };
      if (typeof parsed.question !== "string" || !parsed.question.trim()) throw new Error();
      question = parsed.question;
    } catch {
      res.writeHead(400, { "content-type": "application/json" });
      res.end(JSON.stringify({ error: "expected a JSON body { question: string }" }));
      return;
    }
    const hits = search(index, question);
    const context = hits.map((c, i) => `[${i + 1}] ${c.source} — ${c.heading}\n${c.text}`).join("\n\n");
    const ac = new AbortController();
    res.on("close", () => ac.abort()); // client navigated away → cancel the in-flight generation
    // Create the Session BEFORE committing headers: a model-config failure then returns a real
    // HTTP error instead of an unhandled rejection with a 200 already on the wire.
    let session;

    } catch {
      res.writeHead(503, { "content-type": "application/json" });

      for await (const msg of session.run([userText(prompt)], { approve: async () => "deny", signal: ac.signal })) {
        if (isModelMessage(msg)) {
          const p = msg.payload;

            res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ delta: p.text })}\n\n`);

```

**UI** (`public/index.html`) — a chat interface built per the web-design skill: message list, streamed assistant text appended delta by delta (plain text under the output contract below: escape, split blank-line paragraphs, style the `[n]` markers), `thinking` events into the collapsible reasoning block (collapse it when the first answer delta arrives), the final `sources` event rendered as citations (pill chips or accordion source cards), an empty state inviting the first question with **3–4 example questions the corpus can actually answer** (clicking one submits it), and a visible error state when `/api/ask` fails. Citations must satisfy both of these, never bare text:

- **Reveal the original chunk**: clicking a citation chip (or an inline `[n]`) opens a popover/panel showing the matched chunk's `text` from the sources event **verbatim** — the numbering maps 1:1 to the context blocks in the prompt, so `[n]` always reveals exactly the block the answer drew on.
- **Link to the real document**: inside the popover, `<a href="<url>" target="_blank">` using the `url` field (`/corpus/<path>`, which this server serves) — clicking the chip itself opens the popover, the document link lives within it. When the corpus was cloned from a public repository, prefer mapping the path to the canonical upstream page instead (e.g. the GitHub blob URL derived from the clone URL).

**Output format and language** — settle both up front, in the persona and the retriever, not in the UI:

- **No Markdown pipeline — set the output format instead**: instruct the embedded agent (in `persona.md` and the per-request prompt) to answer in plain text — short paragraphs separated by blank lines, citations as bare `[n]`, no Markdown syntax. The UI then only escapes the text, splits paragraphs and styles the `[n]` markers; there is no renderer to build. When richer structure genuinely matters, have the model emit a small whitelisted HTML subset (`<p> <ul> <li> <strong> <code>`) and sanitize to exactly that whitelist before inserting — never inject unsanitized model output.
- **Cross-language retrieval**: the corpus and the user often speak different languages (English docs, Chinese questions), and BM25 is purely lexical — a Chinese question scores zero against English chunks. At ingest time derive a small bilingual keyword map for the corpus's core vocabulary (10–20 domain terms, e.g. `权限 → permissions / allow / deny`, `钩子 → hooks`) and expand query tokens through it in `search()` before scoring; keep the per-character CJK tokenizer. The persona already pins the answer language to the question's language.

**Persona** (`persona.md`) — the embedded agent's role, written per the agent-creation skill. Shape: one role sentence ("You are an expert on X; you answer strictly from the provided context blocks"), citation and refusal rules, plain-text output (no Markdown — the output contract above), answer language follows the question.

## Verify before you hand over

Never declare the app done without running it:

1. `npm install` succeeds (or the workspace route builds).
2. Model configured for `penguin_data` (CLI or env var; no usable key → see Setup: ask the user to add one to this agent's key vault, and report the app as unverified for now).
3. `npm run ingest` prints `indexed N chunks` with N > 0.
4. Start `npm start` in the background, then ask a real question:
   `curl -N -sS -X POST localhost:4630/api/ask -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"question":"<something the corpus answers>"}'` — expect streamed `data:` deltas ending in a `sources` event that carries `source`, `url` **and the matched chunk `text`** per hit. If nothing streams, the model call failed: re-check step 2 and the provider endpoint before touching the code.
   Then `curl` one of the returned source `url`s — it must return the document, not a 404 (citation links have to resolve).
5. Open the UI (or screenshot it) to confirm the layout renders.

Fix any failure and re-verify; when the app accepts image input, one verification question must include a real image. Report with backtick-wrapped relative paths (`server.ts`, `public/index.html`, …), how to start the app, and the assumptions you made.

## Integrating with the running harness (HMR)

Everything above builds an app that runs **beside** PenguinHarness — its own process, its own data root. When a capability must live **inside** the running system — show up in its UI, extend its workspace, drive its agents — integrate through the harness's HMR API instead of restarting or rebuilding the system. Two rules decide what goes where:

1. **Most functionality does not load through HMR.** Business logic, retrieval, storage, calls to external services — all of that stays in your app or a normal module, built and verified as described above. An HMR-loaded unit is a thin integration seam; when one starts accumulating real logic, move the logic out into app code or a skill and keep the unit thin.
2. **HMR owns exactly the integration surface**: the agent's fixed **workflow** (its `userInput → runAgent` unit), extra **workspace capabilities** (CLI-callable tools, skills), **calls to other agents**, and **UI embedded into the system UI**.

You are the authoring loop: you write the unit, the platform's validator judges it (a 400 response tells you exactly what is wrong), you fix and retry. Never try to weaken or bypass the validator — conform to it.

### Credential

The server publishes a per-boot local-agent credential at `$PENGUIN_HOME/hmr/api.json` (fallback `~/.penguin/hmr/api.json`), containing `{ "url": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>", "token": "<hex>" }`. It is regenerated on every server boot.

```bash
HMR_FILE="${PENGUIN_HOME:-$HOME/.penguin}/hmr/api.json"
[ -r "$HMR_FILE" ] && echo ok || echo missing
HMR_URL=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HMR_FILE'))['url'])")
HMR_TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HMR_FILE'))['token'])")
```

If the file is missing, the server is not running (or you are not on the server machine): say so to the user and stop — do not guess tokens. The HMR APIs are loopback-only by default (403 on exposed binds without HTTPS).

### The workflow contract

A workflow script is the BODY of a strict-mode JavaScript function receiving one argument named `context` (`context.state` is your previously parked state, or null on first install). It must RETURN an object:

- `name`: non-empty string; `version`: number.
- `run(input, ctx)` — the fixed workflow: receives the user input, drives agents through `ctx.runAgent(...)`, returns a JSON result. Keep it a few lines — complexity belongs in skills and app code, not in the workflow body.
- `setup(ctx)` (optional) — register workspace integration points: `ctx.registerTool({ name, description, run })` for tools callable from the workspace and CLI; skill and UI registration go through the same context (the validator's 400 verdict names the exact accepted shape). Registrations are effect-bound: unloading the workflow deregisters exactly what it added.
- `park()` (optional) — return your serializable state; it rides across reloads and platform upgrades.

No `import`/`require`/`await`. No code outside the function body. State discipline: anything worth keeping goes through `park()`/`context.state`; everything else is rebuilt on reload — never stash state in globals.

### Install, verify, iterate

Write the script to a file, JSON-encode it, and install:

```bash
cat > /tmp/workflow.js <<'SCRIPT'
...your script...
SCRIPT
python3 - <<'PY' > /tmp/workflow.json
import json
print(json.dumps({"id": "my-workflow", "script": open("/tmp/workflow.js").read()}))
PY
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HMR_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/workflow.json "$HMR_URL/api/hmr/workflows"
```

- `201` → installed; the response lists the registered integration points.
- `400` → the validator rejected it; `error.message` is the exact verdict (parse error, missing contract field, duplicate tool name…). Fix the script and retry. Do not retry more than 3 times — after that, show the user the last script and the verdict.

Always verify before reporting success — run the workflow (or invoke a registered tool) and check the result against a case you can compute yourself:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HMR_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {}}' "$HMR_URL/api/hmr/workflows/my-workflow/run"
```

Then tell the user the workflow id, what it registered, and one example invocation.

### Maintenance

- `GET /api/hmr/workflows` — installed workflows and their registrations.
- `POST /api/hmr/workflows/<id>/reload` body `{"script": "..."}` — hot-swap the code; the parked state rides across (this is how you upgrade a workflow without losing its data).
- `DELETE /api/hmr/workflows/<id>` — unload; everything it registered deregisters automatically.
